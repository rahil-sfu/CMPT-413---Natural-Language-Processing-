For HW0, I, John Canning, created the repository,
defined the avoid_long_words function from the text book and
made the necessary changes to integrate this function into the Pdist
constructor according to the textbook's implementation to complete
the assignment. I also wrote the report which was the ipynb file 
converted to pdf.
